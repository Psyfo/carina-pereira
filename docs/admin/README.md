# admin docs

this folder groups all admin-related documentation.

## structure

- `dashboard_plan.md` – high-level roadmap for admin & cms.
- `architecture.md` – technical architecture for admin area and api.
- future sub-plans can be added as separate docs here, for example:
  - `contacts_plan.md` (contacts & leads)
  - `courses_plan.md` (course management)
  - `promotions_plan.md` (promotions & discounts)

each sub-plan should:

- start with goals/scope
- list numbered sections (1, 1.1, 1.2, …) so we can reference tasks easily
- stay focused on a single domain so we can work in small, trackable slices
